If one repeatedly has similar experiences under similar circumstances,
then one is supposed to _generalize_ the pattern and conclude that it
will continue. This is the fundamental idea behind
__inductivism__. Eg: Why do we expect the sun to rise tomorrow
morning?  Because in the past (so the argument goes) we have see it
happen. From this we have _derived_ the fact sun will continue to
follow the same pattern.  This is what the scientific doctrine of
__Principal of Induction__ is based upon.

> The future shall resemble the past

The problem arises within the realm of induction when we start using
inductive rules in place of deductive rules. We often end up thinking
using them interchangeably. The difference between both is the fact
that any valid deductive rule is _necessarily_ truth preserving, while
inductive rules are not. In other words, a valid deductive rule cannot
lead from a true premise to a false conculsion while an inductive rule
might.

Let's take an example. If someone we know reads a lot and recommends a
book, we may assume that means we _might_ enjoy the book. This has two
components to it:
1. We _assume_ that they read a lot. This is subjective. If you read
10 pages of a book a day and your friend 20, then they read a lot. But
if someone else you know reads 50 pages then your friend doesn't read
a lot. There's a bit of ambiguity attached to this assumption.
2. The conclusion isn't necessarily true. We _might_ or _might not_
enjoy the recommended book. So the conclusion has some percentage of
_probabilty_ attached to it.

That should present an idea behind the flaws of inductive reasoning.
And why, if assumed to be reliable, it won't lead us to truth.  Now
back to inductivism.

Inductivism's two most serious misconceptions:

1. Inductivism purports to explain to how science obtains _predictions
about experiences_. Just how? Eg: Astrophysics completely annhilites
this concept. Most of the laws of physics that primarily concern
stars, their existence or their composition have never been observed
before. Or take any chemical reactions for that matter. The amount of
surprises that take place while mixing two compounds cannot be based
on the principal of induction.

2. Induction follows the concept that future shall resemble the
past. But that is just not true in reality. Future is and always will
be very different than what the past can anticipate. Eg: Before 1849,
no one knew that people can talk in real time without being present at
the same place.

Therefore, it must be an empty statement that the principal of
induction follows the laws of nature becuase clearly, nature has
broken this law countless times.

Let's take things back to where it started. The original source of
what has become known as the __problem of induction__ is in Book 1,
part iii, section 6 of __A Treatise of Human Nature__ by __David
Hume__, published in 1739. Hume asks on what grounds we come to our
beliefs about the unobserved on the basis of inductive inferences.  He
presents an argument in the form of a dilemma which appears to rule
out the possibility of any reasoning from the premises to the
conclusion of an inductive inference.

According to Hume, there are two possible arguments we can make:
1. A demonstrative argument: produces the wrong kind of conclusion.
2. A probable argument: would be circular. Circular here means that
the argument uses an inductive principle to justify an inductive
principle. While justification of one inductive principle in terms of
another is fine, but ultimately there will be (or needs to be) an
inductive principle for which we can supply no non-circular
justification.

Therefore, for Hume, the problem remains of how to explain why we form
any conclusions that go beyond the past instances of which we have had
experience.

But Hume is just one person, right? Maybe he was just insane to
question something that has been a reliable method for proving
theories for centuries.  Or, maybe not. In __The Logic of Scientific
Discovery (LSD)__, Karl Popper held that induction has no place in the
logic of science. Science, in his view (and many others), is a
deductive process. Popper's theory has been criticized a lot by folks
who know a lot more than me. But it's hard to deny his theory as
_deriving results from experience_ barely gets us closer to the
scientific truth. Scientists formulate hypotheses and theories that is
put to test by deriving particular observable consequences.

And it's very much necessary. One of the conditions for anything to be
scientifically valid is that a theory needs to be testable. If an
experiment cannot be tested on the grounds of some explanation or
expectation then it has the potential of not sustaining itself in the
long run. Or brutally speaking, theory becomes useless. In Brief
history of Time, Hawking mentions that any thoery is valid until
something new comes along and proves it wrong. If that happens, we
need to start over. Ultimate goal, remaining the same i.e., build
explainations and testable arguments for a theory. Inductivism fails
to accomplish this very goal. There's simply no scientific explanation
for any part of the premise.

Like I explained earlier, all inductive inferences have a contingent
nature attached to them. A direct consequence of this characteristic
is the error risk associated. The degree of the risk may vary from
premise to premise.  A very good example in my opinion is
[this proof of an identity given by Ramanujan](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1204311/479722).

With all that being said, it's still hard to completely get rid of
inductive reasoning. Though we are now questioning the reliability of
any inductive method we chose. Let's say we have to derive a
conclusion about an event __E__ based on prior __Es__. We will need to
consider that the inductive method __I__ being used __will__ contain
certain expected error on new cases. We should look for an __I__ with
the least expected error, given enough data. Then again, I'm not
saying you've reached a final _true_ conclusion. You've mught've just
reached a bit closer to it. Or gotten it completely wrong since it's
just deriving from experience and has no testable arguments
associated.
