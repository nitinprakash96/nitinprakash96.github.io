If one repeatedly has similar experiences under similar circumstances,
then one is supposed to _generalize_ the pattern and conclude that it
will continue. This is the fundamental idea behind
__inductivism__. Eg: Why do we expect the sun to rise tomorrow
morning?  Because in the past (so the argument goes) we have see it
happen. From this we have _derived_ the fact sun will continue to
follow the same pattern.  This is what the scientific doctrine of
__Principal of Induction__ is based upon.

> The future shall resemble the past

Indictivism's two most serious misconceptions:

1. Inductivism purports to explain to how science obtains _predictions
about experiences_. Just how? Eg: Astrophysics completely annhilites
this concept.  Most of the laws of physics that primarily concern
stars, their existance or their composition have never been observed
before. Or take any chemical reactions for that matter. The amount of
surprises that take place while mixing two compounds cannot be based
on the principal of induction.

2. Induction follows the concept that future shall resemble the
past. But that is just not true in reality. Future is and always will
be very different than what the past can anticipate. Eg: Before 1849,
no one knew that people can talk in real time without being present at
the same place.

Therefore, it must be an empty statement that the principal of
induction follows the laws of nature becuase clearly, nature has
broken this law countless times.

Let's take things back to where it started. The original source of
what has become known as the __problem of induction__ is in Book 1,
part iii, section 6 of __A Treatise of Human Nature__ by __David
Hume__, published in 1739. Hume asks on what grounds we come to our
beliefs about the unobserved on the basis of inductive inferences.  He
presents an argument in the form of a dilemma which appears to rule
out the possibility of any reasoning from the premises to the
conclusion of an inductive inference.

According to Hume, there are two possible arguments we can make:
1. A demonstrative argument: produces the wrong kind of conclusion.
2. A probable argument: would be circular.

Therefore, for Hume, the problem remains of how to explain why we form
any conclusions that go beyond the past instances of which we have had
experience.

But Hume is just one person, right? Maybe he was just insane to
question something that has been a reliable method for proving
theories for centuries.  Well, maybe not. In __The Logic of Scientific
Discovery (LSD)__, Karl Popper held that induction has no place in the
logic of science. Science, in his view (and many others), is a
deductive process. Scientists formulate hypotheses and theories that
is put to test by deriving particular observable consequences.

And it's very much necessary. One of the conditions for anything to be
scientifically valid is that a theory needs to be testable. If an
experiment cannot be tested on the grounds of some explanation or
expectation then it has the potential of not sustaining itself in the
long run. Or brutally speaking, it is useless.

Inductive inference is not and could not be reasoning, either
deductive or probabilistic, from premises to conclusion, so we must
look elsewhere to understand the conclusion to an argument.
