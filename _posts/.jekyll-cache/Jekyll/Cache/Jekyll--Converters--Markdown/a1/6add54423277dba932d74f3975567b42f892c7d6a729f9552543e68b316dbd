I"&<p>Dynamic programming is a technique for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems. Smaller subproblems are solved only once and stored in a data structure like array, map etc. The fundamental idea being to optimize a given recursive problem and improve upon the complexity.</p>

<p>Stating the same as an RL paradigm:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Dymanic programming refers to solving a given problem using a collection
of algorithms that computes optimal policies given a perfect model of the
environment as a finite Markov decision process.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From the above reference, it should be clear that when we talk about DP we are just formulating a structure for the search of an optimal policy. In any paradigm of solving problems, DP requires two conditions to be satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optimal substructure</li>
  <li>Ovarlapping subproblems</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, MDPs satisfy both the properties.</p>
