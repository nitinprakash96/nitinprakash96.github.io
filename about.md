 Hi, I'm Nitin Prakash. I live in Jaipur, India. I started out as science person having interest in Chemistry but would eventually go on to pursue Computer Science and Engineering. I wrote my very first code in Visual Basic as a school course subject. But later on(10 years later duh!) I switched to C. I am now quite comortable with Python, C++ and Go.

 Computers are really fascinating. And when I first saw a random lecture by Andrej Karpathy on YouTube, I was more inclined to dig into Computers. Specifically, the AI part of it.

 My life(more or less) in bullet points:
 - I read one academic paper a week.
 - I workout 6 days a week. I can deadlift 200 and squat 150 kgs.
 - I like riding motorbikes.
 - I code for at least 4 hours a day.

 And also, I like Star Wars.

 If you want to talk about Codes, Workout or bikes hit me up on my email address [prakash.nitin63@gmail.com](mailto:email@example.com) or tweet me [@nitinprakash96](https://twitter.com/nitinprakash96).

 I'm also a mentor at Codementor. You can contact me there if you want to hire me.
