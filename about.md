 Hi, I'm Nitin Prakash. I live in Bangalore, India. I started out as science person having interest in Chemistry but would eventually go on to pursue Computer Science and Engineering. I wrote my very first code in Visual Basic as a school course subject. But later on(10 years later duh!) I switched to C. I am now quite comfortable with Python, C++ and Clojure.

 Some things I am fond of:
 - Dogs over cats any day.
 - I workout 6 days a week. Would prefer lifting a car over having abs.
 - I like riding motorbikes. Kawasaki ZX-10R is amazing.
 - Love to listen Linkin Park, Breaking Benjamin and Eminem. 

 And also, I like Star Wars.

 If you want to talk about Codes, Workout or bikes hit me up on my email address [me@thenitinprakash.com](mailto:me@thenitinprakash.com) or tweet me [@nitinprakash96](https://twitter.com/nitinprakash96).

 I'm also a mentor at Codementor. You can contact me there if you want to hire me.
