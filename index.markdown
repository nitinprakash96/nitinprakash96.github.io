__Hi there!__

I'm Nitin. I live in Bangalore, India. I started out as science person having interest in Chemistry but would eventually go on to pursue Computer Science and Engineering. 
I wrote my very first code in Visual Basic as a school course subject. But later on(10 years later duh!) I switched to C. I am now quite comfortable with __Python__, __Clojure__ and __Haskell__.

Currently I work as software engineer at [Holmusk](https://holmusk.com) where I write healthcare software in __Haskell__. My interest lies in functional programming but I'm not limited to that. 

Some things I am fond of:

-   Dogs over cats any day.
-   I workout 6 days a week. Would prefer lifting a car over having abs.
-   I like riding motorbikes. Kawasaki ZX-10R is amazing.
-   Love to listen Linkin Park, Breaking Benjamin and Eminem. 

 And also, I like Star Wars.

If you want to talk about Codes, Workout or bikes hit me up on my email address [me@thenitinprakash.com](mailto:me@thenitinprakash.com) or tweet me
