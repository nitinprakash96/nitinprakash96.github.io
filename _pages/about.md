Hi there!
I’m Nitin. I live in Bangalore, India. I started out as science person having interest in Chemistry but would eventually go on to pursue Computer Science and Engineering. I wrote my very first code in Visual Basic as a school course subject. But later on (10 years later duh!) I switched to C. I am now quite comfortable with __Haskell__, __Rust__ and __Clojure__.
Currently I work as software engineer at [Holmusk]("https://holmusk.com") where I write healthcare software in __Haskell__. My interest lies in functional programming but I’m not limited to that.

Some things I am fond of:
- Powerlifting.
- Riding motorcycles. Currently I own a Kawasaki Ninja 650 and a Suzuki Gixxer 250.
- Photography ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nitin_prakash96/))
